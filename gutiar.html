Most guitars have six strings, though some variations, such as 12-string guitars, exist. The strings are attached to the bridge, which transmits their vibrations to the body, contributing to the overall resonance and tone. The bridge may be fixed or adjustable, allowing for individual string intonation and height adjustments.</h3>
