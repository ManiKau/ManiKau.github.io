The definition of skateboarding according to Google, is “ the sport or pastime of riding on a skateboard”. I have pursued skateboarding since I was 8, and have loved the thrill of the tricks, the joy of landing a flip, and the congregation of my fellow friends at the skatepark. Let’s look at this life, by diving deep into the culture and its importance.</h3>

                            <h3>In the 1950s and ’60s, surfers in California starting theorizing of “sidewalk surfing”. They envisioned being able to glide across the streets in the same ways they did on the waves. The first prototype: a pair of roller skates attached to wooden planks. After years of further experimenting, the 1970s saw the first commercial skateboards (thanks to companies like Makaha and Hobie), and along with it, the surge of popularity.</h3>

Rodney Mullen, was so innovative in his tricks, he was dubbed the “Godfather of Street Skating”. He incorporated technical and intricate flatland tricks to further revolutionize freestyle skateboarding. Danny Way on the other hand was known for pushing boundaries and doing what was dubbed impossible.</h3>
