He allied onto a ledge and grinded across it, before kick flipping off. He turned towards out car, and made eye contact with me and smiled. 8 year olf me was mesmerized. 1 week later, I had my own skateboard. It seems almost magic how one glides across a skateboard. But, there is a science behind it, one I’d like to share with you.</h3>

The very first law states that an object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will stay in motion unless acted upon by an external force. Your skateboard will lie at rest when you don’t touch it (duh). Yet, when you are moving off the board, due to the weight of you above it, the wind resistance, and the friction of the ground below, three external forces, the skateboard will eventually stop. That’s why we need to continue pushing the skateboard.</h3>

                            <h3>Mentioning forces of friction, there are multiple that come into play on a skateboard. One of them is the ground. When you push a skateboard on concrete, the skateboard will eventually stop. A skateboard will last longer on concrete than on roads, and it’ll last longer on roads then on dirt paths. While this friction is bad, your grip-tape is good. The purpose of grip-tape is cause your feet to not move and allow better grip. Skateboards are not meant to be slippery, thus, the grip-tape reduces this by creating friction between itself and your shoes. </h3>

The center of mass is important in skateboarding because it affects a skater's stability and balance. By keeping their center of mass positioned above the skateboard, skaters can maintain stability and execute maneuvers effectively. Shifting the center of mass allows skaters to control their movements and perform tricks with precision.</h3>

Potential energy is the stored energy an object has due to its position or condition, and it comes into play when a skater gains elevation. As the skater jumps, potential energy increases because of their raised position. Kinetic energy is the energy possessed by an object in motion, it comes into play as the skater descends or moves along the ground. The potential energy gained during elevation is converted into kinetic energy as the skater moves downward. </h3>

                            <h3>Skateboarding isn’t the same without some flips and tricks. Flips and tricks are a vital part of the enjoyment of skateboarding, and can be described by angular momentum, known as the objects inertia and angular velocity. In context, the rotational motion of the skateboard and the body of the skater. When a skater initiates a spin, they generate angular momentum by exerting torque on the board with their body movements. As a result, the skater and the skateboard start to rotate around a common axis. </h3>

As the skater glides through the air, the molecules of air create resistance against their forward motion. This resistance increases with the square of the skater's velocity, meaning that as the skater goes faster, the force of air resistance becomes stronger.</h3>

Skateboarding is not just a sport of tricks and flips; it's a harmonious blend of science and skill. So please, appreciate the physics at play and recognize the remarkable bond between science and sport.</h3>
