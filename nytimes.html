                            <h3>In the early hours of March 1st, 1980, the French mathematician, Benoit Mandelbrot, became awe-struck by the computer print he held in his hands. His workplace's computer had been used by him in order to graph a mathematical set, and he had initially suspected a simple function would be printed. As he zoomed in closer, instead of finding a simple graph, he found an astonishing fractal. It repeated itself over and over as the zoom increased. Mandelbrot had just made a discovery that would revolutionize the world: he had discovered the Mandelbrot set, a discovery that would make history.</h3>

                            <h3>However, how particularly does the Mandelbrot set work? IBM, the place it all started, explained that the Mandelbrot set is generated by a simple mathematical formula, but its results are anything but simple. The formula takes a complex number, which is a number with both real and imaginary components, and iterates it over and over again. The resulting pattern is a stunning display of infinite complexity, with intricate shapes and details emerging as you zoom in closer and closer.

One of these properties is the concept of self-similarity according to Joe Horgan, a journalist for Scientific American, meaning that the pattern of the set is repeated at various levels of magnification. This self-similarity is what gives the Mandelbrot set its fractal-like appearance.</h3>
