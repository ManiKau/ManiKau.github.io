Inspired by the falling of an apple from a tree, Newton conceived the idea that every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This revolutionary concept provided a profound understanding of celestial mechanics and paved the way for our understanding of the universe.</h3>
