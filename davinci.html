                            <h2>One of Leonardo's most notable inventions was the ornithopter, a flying machine inspired by the flight of birds. He envisioned a contraption with flapping wings that would mimic the movements of avian flight. Leonardo meticulously studied bird anatomy and flight patterns, applying his observations to design a machine that could imitate their graceful motions. </h2>

                            <h2>Leonardo da Vinci conceptualized a precursor to the modern helicopter, known as the aerial screw. This device featured a screw-like structure intended to create vertical lift when rotated. Inspired by the swirling motion of seeds falling from trees, Leonardo believed that by harnessing the power of spiraling air, a human could ascend into the sky. </h2>

He envisioned a parachute, a device intended to slow down the descent of a falling object or person. His parachute design consisted of a pyramid-shaped framework covered with fabric, with the intention of providing a controlled descent and mitigating the risk of injuries. </h2>
